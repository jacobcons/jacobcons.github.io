      <description>I recently finished building the backend for Emote, which is a social network site where you can only post/comment using exclusively emojis. I fancied writing up some of my thoughts on the different decisions/tradeoffs I made along the way.&#xA;SQL I used the query builder knex with most SQL just written raw with the occasional use of knex for dynamic queries when building it out gets ugly. I prefer writing raw sql since you don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn the quirks and syntax of different ORMs and can ensure you exactly know the sql being executed.</description>
